the main goal of this project is to use hooks or lifecycle methods as well as a lot of state. <br>
i would also like to learn using an API to fetch random images to store and use in a component, which i've never done before. 
the concept of memory game is that you are presented with multiple images that get shuffled everytime they are clicked. <br>
you can't click on any image more than once or else your score resets to zero. the objective is to get the highest score possible.
